Certainly! Implementing a file zipper (compressor) using Huffman coding involves building a Huffman tree based on character frequencies and encoding data using a greedy algorithm to minimize the total weighted path length. Here's how we can break down and code this project:

Explanation
Huffman Coding:

Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm. It assigns shorter codes to more frequent characters and longer codes to less frequent ones.
A binary tree is built where each leaf node represents a character and its frequency.
Characters with lower frequencies are deeper in the tree, and higher-frequency characters are closer to the root, leading to shorter codes.
Greedy Algorithm:

The greedy approach is used in building the Huffman tree: repeatedly merging the two nodes with the lowest frequency until one tree remains.
Steps to Implement
Read and count character frequencies in the file.
Build the Huffman tree using a priority queue (min-heap).
Generate Huffman codes by traversing the tree.
Encode the input data using the Huffman codes.
Store the encoded data and the Huffman tree structure for decompression.
